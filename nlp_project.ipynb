              "['critics of president barack obama s foreign policy are getting louder by the day  and that poses risks for democrats this fall and even in 2016  according to previews of hillary clinton s memoirs   hard choices   the former secretary of state distances herself from obama on certain decisions  such as on the question of whether to arm syrian rebels  she wanted to be more aggressive  he did not  democrats have grown more nervous about foreign policy as obama has been working hard to respond to critics who say has nt taken a toughenough line  the controversy over the deal to secure the release of army sgt bowe bergdahl in exchange for five taliban prisoners has flared into an extraordinarily heated debate  obama has watched as his approval rating for handling international affairs has fallen to 41   last month  obama had to stand by as republicans launched another round of congressional investigations into the deaths of four americans in benghazi  libya  russia s aggressive moves into the ukraine stirred talk of a new cold war and concern that the president did nt really have a viable response to this kind of aggression  opinion  why we leave no man behind more recently  the controversies shifted to the president s broader vision or lack thereof  republicans found a lot to dislike in his address at west point  where obama indicated that the nation should step back from using military power as freely as it has done in the past  soon after came the news about the release of bergdahl  in exchange for the release of five notorious taliban prisoners  republicans were quick to accuse the president of negotiating with terrorists  they have also accused him of violating the law by failing to inform congress of the impending deal  even though democrats point to a number of huge accomplishments during the obama presidency  the killing of osama bin laden  the drawdown of the wars in afghanistan and iraq and diplomatic initiatives to bring nuclear disarmament in iran without bloodshed  the critics have upped their volume  all of the recent stories add up to the potential for foreign policy to emerge as a potent issue in the midterm campaigns this fall  congressional democrats could suffer as a result of the unhappiness with the administration s policies  even though midterm elections generally focus on bread and butter questions about the health of the economy  as well as local concerns  there are times when foreign policy can hurt the party of the president  in 1966  for instance  republicans campaigned against lyndon johnson s policies in vietnam  gop officials such as former vice president richard nixon said that johnson was not unleashing enough force against the north vietnamese communists and leaving us troops in a quagmire  in 1978  republicans railed against president jimmy carter for his alleged weakness in foreign policy  claiming that he gave away too much in the panama canal treaties and that he was pursuing a dangerous policy of détente with the soviet union  in 1982  democrats  who were generally focused on the recession  also spoke in favor of a nuclear freeze and warned that president ronald reagan s embrace of the military was bringing the nation close to war  more recently  republicans blasted democrats in 2002 for being weak on defense after having not supported the administration s homeland security bill  and in 2006  democratic candidates returned the favor by criticizing the president s war in iraq as a reckless  unnecessary and extremely costly operation that had actually undermined the war on terrorism  gingrich  bergdahl  boko haram and benghazi while foreign policy carried different levels of weight in these midterms  in some of these contests  such as 1966 and 2006  the administration s actions overseas dismayed voters  will foreign policy play a factor in the 2014 midterms  it is unlikely that it will be a major issue but there are ways it could have an indirect effect on the ballot box and cause trouble for democrats when americans turn out to vote  at the most immediate level  the foreign policy controversy has already distracted the news media from other kinds of stories upon which congressional democrats were hoping to focus  the foreign policy controversy intensified just as there was evidence that the economy was picking up steam and that the obama s health care program was gaining strength  both signs of accomplishment were put on the back burner  overshadowed by the bergdahl debate  the stories also feed the perception of some voters who feel that democrats have not done a good job managing government  this is a white house that once prided itself on competence  obama  a welleducated politician who surrounded himself with bright staff  vowed to avoid the kind of mismanagement that had been on display with hurricane katrina during president george w bush s term  but that reputation has slowly been undercut  especially after the botched health care website rollout and the va scandal  opinion  bergdahl deal was an ugly decision but right some of the coverage of the foreign policy  including recent reports on how the deal with the taliban was handled  have played into these kinds of criticism  the new york times published a lengthy piece about the diminishing returns that obama was able to obtain over the past several years in exchange for the release of the taliban 5 and evidence of how his team had mishandled the process  the berghdal deal is also becoming a way to question the veracity of democratic promises  members of congress  in both parties  have alleged that obama violated the law by ignoring a federal statute that says the president must inform congress one month before such a deal is completed  they have said he is acting exactly like bush  whom he had accused of discounting legislative intent through sweeping notions of executive power  the foreign policy debate puts into focus the argument that obama  as well as the party he leads  lacks a bold vision  this is something that has even frustrated many democrats who feel that the president is too much of pragmatist and not enough of a visionary  the speech at west point fell flat for some americans because it almost seemed focus on excusing what he could nt do rather outlining what he wants to do  during his visit to the philippines  the president explained his outlook on foreign policy by saying   you hit singles  you hit doubles  every once in a while you may be able to hit a home run   the debate over foreign policy helps republicans by riling up the party s base at an opportune time  five months before the election  while at the same time dispiriting the democrats  yes  voters are thinking primarily about how they re faring in today s economy  but on the margins  their perception of their local candidate s views on foreign policy could be a factor in november  opinion  how big a risk are former gitmo prisoners ',\n",

of jamaica   the coast guard suspends a search and rescue case with extremely great care and deliberation   capt todd m coggeshall  chief of response management for the coast guard  said in a news release   after a search area is saturated several times with a maximum number of assets  resources and crew effort  and persons in distress are still not located  a decision is made to suspend a case   jamaica suspended its search because of bad weather  said capt basil jarett of the jamaica defence force  the coast guard said a c130 aircraft located several small objects in the water  the crew used smoke flares and two data marker buoys to mark the location for coast guard and jamaican defense force boat crews  the coast guard said  but none of the searchers could relocate the objects on saturday  jamaica had said one of its military search team spotted the objects  the singleengine tbm900 aircraft  owned by estate developer larry glazer and his wife  jane  crashed into the caribbean

carolina  about 600 miles south of the rochester airport  which it left around 845 am  the pilot asked to descend to 18000 feet because  we have an indication that is not correct in the plane   according to a stream of that transmission posted on liveatcnet  which provides live air traffic control broadcasts  the air traffic controller told the pilot to  stand by  and proceed to 25000 feet as he worked on clearing the plane to go lower  the conversation continued off and on for more than four minutes  though it was largely onesided  the pilot was nt clear in his remarks and did nt declare any sort of emergency  at one point  he simply repeated his call sign twice when the controller asked if he heard the request to drop down to 20000 feet  data indicate the plane did nt descend  it cruised for hours about 25000 feet above the ground  the private plane dropped off radar at 211 pm  according to the flight tracking site flightawarecom  estimates suggested the fuel would have

              " 'lrb cnn rrb  world leaders are meeting in seoul this week to discuss how to deal with the threat of nuclear terrorism  the effort to prevent the misuse of nuclear materials and the spread of nuclear weapons has longplaced most emphasis on defensive measures  these are essentially on the  supply side   aiming to choke off the flow of nuclear weapon components and radiological materials to terrorists  while there is a place for such steps  there is another  and perhaps more successful way  to accomplish the goal  one of the gravest threats to nuclear proliferation arises from the nations that use proxy groups  seemingly independent organizations that are paid to further the interests of governments  ending or reducing the use of such proxy groups has real potential to reduce the availability of such materials to terrorists  perhaps the single  most dominant security threat stems from the nucleartipped country of pakistan  with its accepted use of proxy groups to promote the perceived national interest  thirdparty transfer  where a country receiving weapons sells or gives them to another party  is always a danger  and with it looms the possible catastrophe of nuclear weapons in the wrong hands  it is clear that the us government is working hard with pakistani officials to ensure that security at nuclear facilities and radioactive material storehouses is more robust  this has been taking place for years  for example  david e sanger and william j broad s new york times article in 2007 lrb us secretly aids pakistan in guarding nuclear arms rrb describes initiatives undertaken from the time of the clinton and bush administrations and the complexities associated with efforts to work with an ally that remains fundamentally  suspicious  of our intentions  but the broader question remains  why does pakistani leadership continue its halfhearted support for counterterror practices aimed at those in a position to acquire such materials  for one thing  pakistan has a legacy of using proxy groups to promote its national security interests that goes back at least to the 1950s  at the time  prime minister mohammad daud khan of afghanistan worked to stoke nationalist demands and aspirations from the pashtun population in geographical locales near the  durand line   the disputed border between pakistan and afghanistan  in turn  pakistani leaders used islam as a framework and its own proxies as counterweights  to promote an alternate vision of a unified region unfettered by political instability and social unrest  lashkaretayyiba lrb  army of the righteous  rrb is perhaps the most prominent pakistani proxy in the contemporary world because it is generally recognized as having carried out the mumbai terrorist assaults in 2008  this terrorist group is long known for its fierce struggle in kashmir against indiansupported political leaders and indian security forces  to be sure  pakistan is not the only country in south asia that practices international politics in this way  india has also used its own set of proxies to promote national interest in effective and sustained ways in places such as afghanistan and bangladesh  but while the use of proxies in the region is not especially new  the risks nowadays are compounded by the presence of nuclear weapons and radiological materials  it is vital that pakistan comes to grips with its use of proxy groups and explores alternatives  the use of proxies in pursuit of national policy also has implications with respect to iran  with its track record of trying to enhance its power in iraq by supporting insurgents and providing knowhow for the building of improvised explosive devices  in afghanistan  where the weak karzai government remains unable or unwilling to meet its security obligations outside of kabul  iranian proxies wield their influence  it is likely that iranian leaders support the shia organizations in sunnidominated pakistan as well as shia militant group sipahemuhammad with the broader aim of destabilizing pakistan  in no small part to undermine american efforts in the region  what does that portend for possible shortrun relationships between israel and pakistan if iran is deemed a common threat  in turn  what does that portend for the united states from its own geostrategic position  we should take a page out of the conflict resolution literature playbook and use bargaining techniques that seek to isolate and identify motivations behind pakistan s position on the use of proxy groups  for example  the fears and anxieties political leaders experience often drive  hardline  bargaining positions on issues  and knowing what those fears are in the case of pakistan  us leadership can work to relieve those fears by providing alternatives  another technique is to break down large seemingly unsolvable problems into smaller  more manageable ones  for instance  the broader policy of drone use by the us can be broken down into smaller policies where agreement is possible  one possibility is putting in place tighter restrictions to satisfy pakistan s leaders on when drones should be used  in what specific cases or as backups to other forms of interdiction  in turn  compromises like those can and should be linked to issues of importance to the us such as stronger pakistani support for us talks with the taliban and greater transparency by the pakistanis about security policies  such talks might start a process that could lead to new agreements that come closer to confronting pakistani proxy use  all of this requires unequivocal american commitment to pakistan for the long haul  to allay fears of abandonment  against that backdrop  such problemsolving efforts would generate alternatives that might lead to innovative thinking about new security arrangements in pakistan and other countries such as india and afghanistan  it is possible to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and radiological material dissemination by reducing reliance on proxy groups  and that could be our most effective tool in this ongoing battle  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of richard chasdi

afghans clad in security force garb  the man opened fire on the troops in the volatile helmand province  said maj lori hodge  a spokeswoman for the international assistance security force  hodge did not immediately provide details about the attack  one of a handful in recent weeks to target nato troops  a defense department official said the three troops killed were part of a special operations forces mission to stabilize a village in the sarwan qala area  they were meeting with local officials  nato and afghan troops have been searching for the gunman   it is too early to say that this latest incident is part of a steppedup effort on the insurgents  part   white house spokesman jay carney said   we know they are trying to maximize media exposure of these events but our military believes that the operational impact has been negligible  nonetheless these incidents do concern us and our hearts go out to all the victims and their families   in the strikes  known as  greenonblue  attacks  afghan security forces or militants dressed as local police or soldiers target coalition troops  the problem has sapped troop morale  and coalition forces have been working to address it  earlier this year  gen john allen  commander of the natoled force  said the systems that afghans and coalition forces had put in place to help prevent these attacks were having an effect  allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of afghans who sign up for the army or police force  and the afghans  have taken a lot of steps themselves   bill roggio  a terrorism analyst  said afghan security personnel have killed an estimated 93 isaf soldiers since may 2007  and they have killed 31 this year alone across the country  these attacks have taken place in all areas in afghanistan  not just in the south and east  said roggio  managing editor of the long war journal blog  which reports and analyzes terror issues  two other greenonblue incidents occurred this week  roggio said  one was the killing of a us soldier tuesday by two afghans wearing army uniforms  on thursday  us troops killed an afghan soldier who tried to gun them down at a training center in laghman province   the attack types are about split  about half seem to be taliban infiltrators  or ansf members who were turned by the taliban   said roggio  ansf stands for afghan national security forces  remembering the chinook crash  a year later  the other half seem to be disgruntled security personnel who have turned on troops for some sort of grievance  it is very difficult to know exactly what is happening given that isaf does not release a lot of information on these attacks   afghan intelligence agents have started going undercover during recruit training to spot signs of extremist tendencies among the newcomers  military officials say   the us military has become so concerned with the greenonblue attacks that it has ordered units to designate  guardian angels  in each unit whose job is to provide security for troops working with afghans  but the attacks have not abated   roggio said  elsewhere in helmand  a vehicle struck a roadside mine friday  killing six civilians and wounding five others  president hamid karzai s office said  women and children were among the casualties in the bombing  which karzai condemned  the british defense ministry announced friday that one of its soldiers was killed in  enemy action  while on patrol in the nad ali district of helmand on thursday  highprofile insurgent attacks against nato and afghan targets

pakistan   on behalf of president obama and the american people  i have sent my deepest condolences to ragaei s family and to the entire us mission in afghanistan   us secretary of state hillary clinton said in a written statement released late thursday  the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack  saying two bombers targeted the american soldier near the entrance of the compound of the province council in asadabad  according to a statement released by spokesman zabiullah mujahid  mujahid said the attack occurred as the troops were exiting a military vehicle and gathering to enter the compound  the taliban claimed to have killed 17 soldiers  though the group is known to routinely claim responsibility for attacks and inflate casualty numbers  the defense department identified

without a capacity for progress  and thus beyond historical analysis  neither webster nor sarkozy was correct  of course  scholars of africa and its diaspora  in the 19th century and today  have

association for the study of africanamerican life and history rrb  woodson s association created the journal of negro history to promote research and writing on africa and its diaspora in an era during which much of the historical profession was indifferent to the subject  woodson began with just a week  he noted how in early february americans celebrated the birthdays of abraham lincoln and frederick douglass and deemed it black history week  woodson s goal was to make history available to teachers  students and the public  the civil rights and black power movements fueled interest  so much so that by 1976  the association expanded the national marking of black history to the month that we know today  to some degree  woodson s goals have been realized  black history is a major

has lapsed in the testing and audits that would have kept security up to standard   we see this a lot  it happens frequently in other places where there are static security forces  and it s just a

the exchange between actor kevin james and the automated phone system in the 2007 film  i now pronounce you chuck and larry   a scene that correctly assumes moviegoers have had personal experience with the absurdity of nonhuman customer service  who has nt  we ve all waited through the recitation of menu items  none of which were related to our actual question  we ve all hit zero repeatedly  hoping to be transferred to a real person  when that did nt work  maybe we even lost our temper  shouting  representative   over and over  whether the robot had given us that option or not  why has nt there been a mass revolt against automated systems  the answer is simple  we believe that this nonsense is temporary  we believe that computers are on the cusp of being able to understand human language  and that belief  according to many linguists and cognitive scientists  is completely wrong  first  there s the problem of voice recognition itself  julie sedivy  a professor of linguistics and psychology at the university of calgary  told me that simply recognizing speech sounds and matching them up with specific words is much more complicated than most people realize   the way i say  dog  will depend on my age  gender  geographic dialect  the particular anatomy of my vocal tract  and how quickly or formally i m speaking   she said   humans are able to calibrate their perception after hearing just a couple of seconds of someone s speech  but really good speech recognition is still a problem for many programs   although this technology has steadily improved for the past 20 years   speech recognition systems are still markedly inferior to human beings in understanding spoken language   said john nerbonne  a linguist and information sciences professor based in the netherlands   telephones are a particularly difficult medium because they limit the signal a good deal   furthermore  studies show that people almost universally hate automated phone systems  and that most customers are even willing to pay more to speak to an actual person   ally bank  discover card and td bank all have ads on television right now that brag about the fact that if you call the phone number  a real live person will answer   said adam goldkamp  spokesperson for gethuman  an organization dedicated to improving customer service  such is the sad state of the current customer service world  in other words  only now are companies starting to wake up to the lost revenue potential of frustrated customers who give up on the automated system and take their business elsewhere   when you see companies launching ads like these  it shows they understand that there are things they can do to increase their future revenue by giving customers what they want  an actual person to speak to when they have an issue   goldkamp said  maybe one day in the future  automated systems will be able to identify our words with perfect accuracy  even then  there is still an insurmountable problem  the ability to understand what we mean by those words   we re a long way from being able to communicate with computers in real language   said suzanne kemmer  director of cognitive sciences and associate professor of linguistics at rice university   human language has a powerful design feature that works great for normal persontoperson interactions  but is completely at odds with the way computers work   computers are based on formal logic and fixed categories  she explained  human language is flexible and dynamic  and follows a cognitive logic that differs fundamentally from computers  in short  human words and grammatical structures do nt have fixed meanings  instead  they have a certain amount of vagueness and ambiguity built in  so that their meaning is highly affected by context  actually understanding meaning is a very different problem from voice recognition or from the autocorrect on your computer or phone  kemmer said  when i brought up this topic with harvard professor steven pinker  one of the world s most influential linguists  he noted that major companies  by looking for statistical patterns in large datasets and applying them to user input  have largely dropped the ball when it comes to real artificial intelligence   the stupidity of a lot of computer language understanding systems comes from the fact that they ve turned their backs on genuine intelligence and satisfied themselves with statistics   in other words  computers are still very bad at trying to guess what we mean when we say something  they also do nt get our social and emotional psychology   often the automated phone systems were developed with a tin ear to the way people interact with each other   pinker told me   they sound like people  but if you think of them as such  they are the most infuriating people in the world  when i hit  0  to get a human being  and a voice dripping with a combination of mock concern and mock confusion says   i m sorry  but i did not understand your answer   i am apt to go into a rage    if this were a real person   pinker added   she would be simultaneously stupid  mendacious  and condescending   it s time to stop the madness  we are not on the cusp of inventing computers that understand human language  silicon valley can  and will  continue to strive for this goal  in the meantime  let s stop kidding ourselves  let s admit that computers  by themselves  are terrible at customer service  let s admit that  at a time of economic uncertainty and job losses  we should be supporting companies that employ real people to answer our questions  let s admit that  unless we demand change  we will be forced  forever  to deal with an automated system that thinks our name is barry shmalenpine  the opinions expressed in this

winner will play into her 30s before fully turning her attention to her numerous business interests   i think she s going to play another four to five years and through the rio olympics lrb in 2016 rrb if she stays healthy and hungry   her longtime agent and close friend max eisenbud told cnn s open court  sharapova s motivation has never been an issue in the past  and the russian  who turned 26 last week  is now fully fit  that  however  was nt the case in 2008  when the shoulder injury ruled her out for nine months and cast doubt on sharapova s professional career  which began on the day she turned 14  she had been experiencing discomfort in her right  and serving  shoulder  with initial tests leading doctors to believe inflammation was the cause  when the pain intensified after a win at a tournament in montreal in july 2008  she underwent an mri that revealed two small tears in the tendon of her shoulder  so began the long process of rehabilitation  surgery  another stint of rehab and dealing with another injury  a bone bruise  it was a difficult time for sharapova   the shoulder  it s a huge part of the tennis game   she told open court   the serve is huge and my game is all about being aggressive and powerful strokes  so when you re out of the game nine months  when you do nt have too many examples of athletes coming back after such an injury  of course you have doubters   sharapova never lost faith that she would recover  but she would have to wait another three years before reaching another grand slam final  losing at wimbledon in 2011  thankfully for sharapova  no such serious injuries have reoccurred  although she was troubled by an ankle problem later that year   i had to work through a lot of things  and more mentally as well because i always thought that during those months that i was away  everyone was working and everyone was training and everyone was playing so it kind of felt like i was left behind a little bit   she said  eisenbud s pronouncement about sharapova s future comes as a boost to the women s tennis tour due to sharapova s enormous star power and fan base  which increased when she won the french open last june to cap her comeback and become just the 10th woman to capture all four majors  forbes lists sharapova was last year named by forbes as the world s 71st most powerful celebrity  she was the highestranked female athlete on the list  ahead of serena williams  despite the american now owning 11 more grand slam titles  sharapova is  according to forbes  the world s highestpaid female athlete  pulling in almost  28 million  more than her career prize money  over a 12month period that ended last july  sponsors including samsung  evian  nike  tiffany  co  head  cole haan and  most recently  porsche help pad sharapova s wallet  the floridabased russian has also launched sugarpova  her own premium candy line  in the us and plans on expanding to china  japan  india and england  but sharapova remains adamant that success on the court is her first priority  the rest will follow   do i want my candy to sell  do i want my partnership to continue for many years  of course i do   sharapova said   that s a nobrainer  but at the end of the day all the things that have come to me  that i ve been able to be a part of  is because i m a tennis player  not because i m a model or because of acting  the core of what i have is my tennis   her results in 2013 confirm sharapova s drive  known as one of tennis  toughest competitors and hardest workers  she has showed no signs of slowing down  the power baseliner has reached at least the semifinals in all four of her tournaments and almost completed a rare double at the bnp paribas open in indian wells and miami s sony open  she won the title in california in march but was defeated by williams in the finale in florida two weeks later  her poor record against williams might add to her hunger  williams beat sharapova for the 11th straight time  although sharapova won a set off the world no 1 for the first time in five years  missing gold sharapova lacks an olympic gold medal  too  having been crushed by williams in the gold medal match at london 2012 and missing 2008 in beijing with the shoulder injury   i always feel like i can be better and when i do step on the court  i feel a certain power with what i m doing   sharapova said   i feel strong and i feel like i m good at what i do   i want to keep working  and i want to keep getting better because you ca nt stand still  everyone s working  i m sure everyone s getting stronger and getting faster and hitting the ball harder  you have to do it as well   sharapova begins her claycourt swing as defending champion in stuttgart this week before competing at the madrid open and italian open in rome ahead of her title defense at roland garros  which starts may 26  her titles in stuttgart and rome in 2012 served as the springboard to her success in paris  where sharapova downed italian sara errani in the final  having come back from the abyss that her careerthreatening injury presented  sharapova savored the success  especially after being written off by many critics while she was rebuilding her career  suffering some moralesapping defeats   losing is never easy  especially when you ve achieved so much great success and having lifted beautiful trophies   she said   and especially when you hear it from people that  you know  they sit there and comment on what you re doing and they do nt comment on the work that you put in before something like that  before getting to the stage of a match in front of thousands of people   but it makes you so much stronger  and i ve looked back and  you know  the people i felt had that connection with me  i ve certainly spoken with them about it and especially had a few words with them after the french open   but it s sport  it s normal  i think the world revolves around comments and opinions  and i have absolutely nothing

              " 'lrb cnn rrb  the us food and drug administration approved a new prescription diet drug called qsymia on tuesday  the medication produced dramatic weight loss in clinical trials  but some are concerned over potential side effects  including increased heart rate  birth defects and other issues  qsymia lrb pronounced kyoosimeeuh rrb is the second diet drug approved this year  the fda approved a weightloss pill called belviq on june 27  qsymia had been known as qnexa until its approval  the fda asked the company to change the name to avoid confusion with another drug on the market  according to the company  patients in clinical trials experienced more dramatic weight loss with qsymia than with belviq  on qsymia  patients went from an average 227 pounds to 204 pounds  on belviq  the average weight dropped from 220 to 207  some consumer advocates worry that the weight loss comes with a price  some patients in the clinical trial suffered an increased heart rate and a condition called metabolic acidosis  which can lead to hyperventilation  fatigue and anorexia  concerns have also been raised about birth defects  one of the ingredients in qsymia is topiramate  an anticonvulsant that has been linked to birth defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate in babies born to women who have taken it for migraines or seizures  qsymia s other ingredient is phentermine  an appetite suppressant   our belief is that women will be invited to compelling advertising and marketing messages to experiment on themselves with a drug that has some effectiveness with healthy weight loss but possible serious risks   said cindy pearson  executive director of the national women s health network  qsymia s manufacturer  vivus inc  says that the drug helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in obese people and that people taking it were less likely to get type 2 diabetes  not enough good data to back obesity drug  panel says  obesity is not being adequately addressed by diet and lifestyle changes or currently available therapies   the company said   the need for new options is urgent  particularly nonsurgical options   the fda approved qsymia only for obese people or for overweight people with a body mass index greater than 27 who also suffer from weightrelated conditions like hypertension and diabetes  doctors are free to prescribe the drug to anyone  however  and there are concerns that physicians will open  pill mills  and prescribe qsymia to people who just want to lose a few pounds  that s what happened in the 1990s with fenphen  another diet drug combination that includes phentermine  an fda advisory committee voted against qsymia s approval in 2010  the panel recommended the drug s approval with a 202 vote in february  after vivus proposed a risk management program to limit qsymia s distribution and published additional results from one of its three clinical trials  vivus will at first offer the pill only through mail order  so doctors ca nt sell it directly  said dr barbara troupin  vivus  vice president of scientific communications and risk management   there will not be dispensing from doctors  offices   she said   seeing that issue and what has happened in fad and diet drugs in the past  that is not a path that we re going to be taking   the 4430 overweight and obese patients in the qsymia studies experienced various levels of weight loss  about half of patients on the recommended dose lost 10  of their weight  while fourfifths lost 5   that amounts to about 12 pounds for a 227pound person  meg evans  one of the patients  started out at 230 pounds and lost 48 pounds her first year on the drug and another two pounds the second year   i loved it   she said   i was nt hungry  i almost had to

i can pass on it    evans said  she said the weight came off gradually  about four pounds a month  and her blood pressure went down almost immediately  despite the pill s apparent ability to help people lose weight  some critics expressed concerns because of the possible side effects   i believe that if the public were to  buy  lrb qsymia rrb after fda approval  it would run the risk of severe  even fatal  consequences from another diet lemon   dr michael lauer writes in annals of internal medicine  also noting that the drug led to a slight increase in heart rates  in february  lauer was one of two fda advisory committee members who voted against qsymia s approval  the fda and vivus both acknowledge that the three clinical trials meant to measure qsymia s safety and effectiveness were not designed to properly assess cardiovascular risk  the fda has required vivus to do a study on the drug s cardiovascular effects  vivus said it would be done after the drug s approval  despite the label s warning that women of childbearing age should use birth control while on qsymia  there are concerns that women will still get pregnant while on the drug  the fda recommends a pregnancy test every month while on qsymia  in the drugmaker s twoyear clinical trial  34 women on qsymia became pregnant  even though they were told repeatedly to use contraception  no birth defects happened in those pregnancies  according to the company  previous clinical trials of topiramate  one of the ingredients in qsymia  have shown a risk of about five birth defects for every 1000 pregnancies  comparing the antiobesity drug to treatments for other chronic diseases  troupin said patients will probably need to continue taking qsymia longterm  though the new drug is not expected to be widely covered by health insurance plans  fda rejects another obesity drug evans  the patient who lost 50 pounds on the drug  said she has gained back about 20 pounds since the clinical trial ended two years ago and looks forward to going on qsymia once it s approved  even though it can have side effects   there are side effects to everything   she said  she added that the drug was nt the only reason she lost weight  weekly counseling on nutrition and exercise were a big factor  too  the counselor helped her change her diet  choosing a salad for lunch instead of a burger  forgoing pasta and potatoes at dinner  and encouraged her to walk a few times a week in addition to her regular exercise as goalie in a women s soccer league   before the medicine  i had been telling the girls they d have to find a new goalie  because i could nt dive for the ball like i did before   she said   then i lost the weight  and i was diving and bouncing back up and having a great old time again  ',\n",

making it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ecb to fund lending to small businesses  but the banks would nt be sitting on money in the first place if they had creditworthy business clients eager to take out loans  indeed  rather than clamoring for new loans from the ecb  the banks have been paying down existing ones  what is needed are policies addressed not to lenders  but to potential borrowers and spenders  who are holding back because of the dismal prospects for growth  a significant chunk of responsibility lies on the shoulders of draghi and other ecb leaders for the eurozone s utter failure to construct a plausible model for growth since the crisis  after a brief period of fiscal stimulus in 2009  the eurozone has pursued an austerity agenda that compounds the weakness of private demand by shrinking public demand  draghi and his predecessor jeanclaude trichet did all they could to ensure monetary easing was accompanied by fiscal tightening  in effect refusing to hit the gas pedal unless governments were standing on the brakes  this seemingly bizarre policy does have a rationale  the idea is to force the countries of the eurozone periphery become more competitive through cutting costs and especially wages  enabling growth through exports rather than domestic demand  to some extent  the policy has worked  savage levels of unemployment and ecbbacked measures to reduce labor bargaining power have lowered costs in the periphery  by the end of 2013  exports accounted for over 27  of eurozone gdp  up from 23  on the eve of the financial crisis  further  the eurozone trade surplus exceeded 3  of gdp  these figures are the highest since the introduction of the euro  despite these unprecedented developments  eurozone growth remains exceedingly weak  that demonstrates the deep intellectual failure behind the austeritycompetitiveness agenda  the rickety exportled growth model faces another important threat  the euro s dramatic appreciation  draghi s famous july 2012 pledge to do  whatever it takes  to preserve the euro stopped the flight from sovereign bonds and other eurodenominated financial assets  trade surpluses also tend to promote currency appreciation  the stronger euro raises the prices of the currency bloc s businesses versus their competitors  reversing a substantial portion of the painfully won competitiveness gain  this accounts for the efforts of draghi and others to talk the euro down  but the effect has not offset the appreciation  while draghi clearly hopes that today s measures will further weaken the euro  they are unlikely to have much effect  for all their exceptional character  today s ecb measures are  at best  efforts to shore up a fundamentally misguided growth model that is doomed to collapse  a serious policy to fight deflation requires putting both feet on the gas  with monetary stimulus and fiscal stimulus working together  a model that has had some success in japan  it requires abandoning the mirage of exportled growth as a savior for the eurozone  and vigorous efforts to stoke demand by increasing government spending and promoting wage growth  only this will lead to a virtuous circle of borrowing  lending  and growth  and a sustainable rate of price growth  but draghi s statement today revealed how very far he is from recognizing this point  he once again reiterated his support for austerityled policies whose only coherent rationale is to promote falling lrb or at best stagnant rrb prices in the eurozone s periphery  in other words  precisely the deflation he claims to wish to avoid  until this fundamental contradiction is resolved  the eurozone is going nowhere  read more  ecb cuts rates to head off deflation risk read more  europe may be recovering  but crisis not over

bakeries  people have been decapitated  millions of syrians are displaced  but a single  horrifying attack has crossed what us president barack obama called a  red line   rebel officials say more than 1300 people  including many women and children  died recently as a result of chemical weapons  the united states believes syria was behind it  rebels blame the syrian government as well  the syrian regime denies it  and some syrians have told cnn they doubt their government used chemical weapons  given the massive human toll of attacks with conventional weapons  what makes this a potential turning point for the world to act  what justifies intervening if syria uses chemical weapons  conventional attacks called no  less evil   blowing your people up with high explosives is allowable  as is shooting them  or torturing them   complains dominic tierney  political science professor at swarthmore college   but woe betide the syrian regime if it even thinks about using chemical weapons   in a column in the atlantic  tierney  author of a book on what he calls  the american way of war   adds   a woman and her child under fire in aleppo might miss this distinction  it s not obvious that high explosives are inherently less evil than chemical weapons   writer paul waldman makes similar comments in the american prospect   getting killed by mustard gas is surely awful  but so is getting blown up by a bomb  using one against your enemies gets you branded a war criminal  but using the other does nt   and the los angeles times  paul whitefield writes   bombs blowing up buildings  which

chemical attack obama tells cnn  us interests at stake the white house argues there s good reason to view chemical weapons attacks differently   the use of chemical weapons is contrary to the standards adopted by the vast majority of nations and international efforts since world war i to eliminate the use of such weapons   spokesman jay carney said this week     the use of these weapons on a mass scale and a threat of proliferation is a threat to our national interests and a concern to the entire world   he added   without question  there is ongoing barbarity in syria  perpetrated by the assad regime  and we have provided substantial assistance to the syrian opposition and will continue to provide substantial assistance to the syrian opposition in their struggle with assad   obama  in an interview with cnn last week  said   when you start seeing chemical weapons used on a large scale  that starts getting to some core national interests that the united states has  both in terms

chlorine  phosgene lrb a choking agent rrb and mustard gas lrb which inflicts painful burns on the skin rrb caused nearly 100000 deaths  according to the united nations  but since world war i  chemical weapons have killed more than a million people  the un says   the cold war period saw significant development  manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons   the un office for disarmament affairs says  the most notorious case in recent history came in 1988  during the iraniraq war  saddam hussein used them against kurds in iraq s kurdish city of halabja  and against iranian troops  in 1992  the chemical weapons convention was adopted  calling for the prohibition on chemical weapons   should we have any boundaries in war   some analysts say it makes sense for the united states and the world to respond differently to chemical attacks   they re so indiscriminate   says don borelli  a former fbi official now with the soufan group  a security consultancy   at least there s some discrimination in conventional weapons    modern weaponry  while it s grown more lethal  has also grown more precise   says michael rubin  a former pentagon official now with the american enterprise institute  but chemical agents disperse to affect large numbers of people and  can produce horror for a lifetime   some conventional attacks do the same  he acknowledges  but there s another reason that it makes sense to view a chemical attack as a reason for international intervention  rubin says   we want to establish the parameters of warfare  if you do nt  combatants will keep pressing the boundaries  ultimately  the question is  should we have any boundaries in war or not   it s a slippery slope  he says  if a chemical weapons attack goes unchecked  what about some other form of weapon of mass destruction  a biological or nuclear attack  some chemical attacks have gone unchecked  in the current conflict  chemical weapons are alleged to have been used on a smaller scale several times  and foreign policy reports this week that says the united states  back in 1988   helped saddam as he gassed iran   rubin said he doubts that  but either way  he said   there s a fundamental question  should we learn from our mistakes  if we did the wrong thing should we simply sit by the wayside and allow that to happen again   the united states and other countries  he said  want to  restore a stigma  against chemical weapons that was in place in the world s psyche  after world war i and halabja   intervening in middle east turmoil  mission impossible  analyst  chemical weapons  impact  exaggerated  tony cordesman  a former defense department official now with the center for strategic and international studies  says the image people have of chemical weapons is often exaggerated   chemical weapons attacks are not necessarily any more horrifying than the use of conventional weapons   he said tuesday  and  the lethality has always been far worse on paper than in reality   there are no definitive statistics on how many people were killed in halabja  he says  the prevailing image many people have is still from world war i   which was the last really mass use of chemical weapons   cordesman adds  tierney  in the atlantic  suggests a  strategic selfinterest  for the united states to oppose chemical weapons   powerful countries like the united states cultivate a taboo against using wmd partly because they have a vast advantage in conventional arms   he writes    washington can defeat most enemy states in a few days  unless the adversary uses wmd to level the playing field   rubin rejects that argument  saying the us advantage in weapons of mass destruction precludes any possibility of a level playing field  and while the alleged previous  smallerscale use of chemical weapons in the syrian civil war were not enough to bring about calls for action  he said   this is such a blatant example  we ca nt pretend not to see it  ',\n",

ahead of the verdict  hundreds of supporters gathered outside the central moscow courthouse  security officers  who maintained a heavy presence outside the building  whisked several people away while others stood in belowfreezing temperatures chanting  freedom  and  russia without putin   referring to the prime minister  khodorkovsky had expressed a desire to run for office at one time and funded opposition political parties  he has said the trial was part of a kremlin campaign to destroy him and take the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s  the kremlin has denied any role  pavel khodorkovsky said that he had been expecting a guilty verdict for his father  but also  had hoped that president lrb dmitry rrb medvedev s rhetoric about judicial system reform would actually bear some fruit    however  today  i realize that the judge is completely subservient and is a slave to the political will of mr lrb russian prime minister vladimir rrb putin and other bureaucrats in the kremlin   the younger khodorkovsky said  a white house statement monday also criticized the case  saying it  appears to be an abusive use of the legal system for improper ends    the apparent selective application of the law to these individuals undermines russia s reputation as a country committed to deepening the rule of law   said the statement by white house press secretary robert gibbs   the statement added that the united states would continue monitoring developments in the case  in a separate statement  us secretary of state hillary clinton said the conviction  raises serious questions about selective prosecution  and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations    this and similar cases have a negative impact on russia s reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate   clinton s statement said  the court was originally scheduled to read the verdict in the trial on december 15  but it was unexpectedly postponed  the yukos oil company was once russia s largest oil producer  khodorkovsky is serving an eightyear sentence for fraud and tax evasion  having underpaid taxes on the oil his company produced  yukos was later broken up and absorbed by the state  khodorkovsky has already told the moscow court that its decision will have an impact far beyond him and lebedev   there is much more than just the fates of two people in your hands   khodorkovsky said   right here and right now  the fate of every citizen of our country is being decided   in october  prosecutors asked for a 14year prison sentence but said it should include the eightyear term that khodorkovsky is already serving  which will end in october 2011  with time served  the sentence could keep khodorkovsky in jail until 2017  the former oil magnate was previously incarcerated in a work camp near the town of krasnokamensk  6500 kilometers lrb 4000 miles rrb from his native moscow  but when the new charges were brought against the two men  both were moved to moscow last year to stand trial  the court also ordered khodorkovsky and lebedev to pay about  600 million in back taxes  few doubt that khodorkovsky s prosecution has taken on a symbolism far beyond his own innocence or guilt  critics say the embezzlement charges against him are absurd  analysts say russia itself  and its commitment to the rule of law  is on trial   this verdict will be a verdict on whether russia is a lawgoverned state  or whether it ever aspires to become one   said masha lipman of the carnegie endowment   because currently it is not a lawgoverned state and the trial of khodorkovsky and his partner lebedev is the most striking example of it   in his final address to the court  khodorkovsky made a last impassioned appeal   for me  as for anybody  it is hard to live in jail  and i do not want to die there  but if i have to  i will not hesitate  the things i believe in are worth dying for

              " 'a train crash in santiago de compostela  spain  that killed at least 80 people and injured 178 more wednesday poses many questions for investigators  who are homing in on what role the train s speed may have played in the crash  the issue of highspeed rail may raise more questions for the public at large  specifically in the united states  where highspeed trains are rare  here are some basics on this speedy mode of transportation  what is highspeed rail  it depends where you are  but the international union of railways says the term is reserved for systems lrb not just trains rrb designed for speeds of more than 250 kph lrb 155 mph rrb if the lines are new and speeds up to 220 kph lrb 137 mph rrb if the lines are upgraded  certain trains in china and the european union can exceed 300 kph lrb 186 mph rrb  while a handful around the world can top 400 kph lrb 249 mph rrb  the term can also be used for trains that move at speeds between 110 kph and 180 kph lrb 68 mph to 112 mph rrb in certain circumstances  such as the need to avoid  noise and nuisance   or the need to traverse long tunnels or bridges  how is highspeed rail different from nation to nation  as stated above  china and the eu have trains that can exceed 300 kph lrb 186 mph rrb  which means  in china  trains can zip between beijing and wuhan in about five hours  the regular train route takes twice as long  and you d be lucky to finish the journey in a car in 13 hours  in japan  the shinkansen bullet trains typically travel at between 270 kph lrb 169 mph rrb and 320 kph lrb 199 mph rrb  while korea train express cars can travel up to 305 kph lrb 190 mph rrb  in march  korea s hemu430x hit a speed of 4214 kph lrb 2618 mph rrb in a test run  making korea the fourth country  behind france  china and japan  to develop a train capable of topping 420 kph lrb 261 mph rrb  spain has highspeed trains  known as aves  that move at speeds up to 310 kph lrb 193 mph rrb  according to railway gazette  but the train involved in this week s wreck was not an ave it had a max speed of 250 kph lrb 155 mph rrb  is highspeed rail available in the united states  amtrak operates a service in the northeastern united states called acela express that is capable of speeds up to 241 kph lrb 150 mph rrb and can travel between new york city and washington in about 96 minutes  other stops on the route include boston  philadelphia  baltimore and new haven  connecticut  responding to critics who say acela is too slow and too infrequently reaches its top speed  amtrak announced in september that it plans to run test trains at 266 kph lrb 165 mph rrb in delaware  maryland  new jersey  rhode island and massachusetts  what does the future hold for highspeed rail in the us  early in the obama administration  federal transportation officials called on states to spend money to develop faster rail systems using existing lines  the plan identified 10 potential highspeed corridors for federal funding  and the white house proposed spending  53 billion over 25 years to create the national network  among the corridors  california  the pacific northwest  the midwest  the southeast  the gulf coast  pennsylvania  florida  new york and new england  the blueprint envisioned some trains traveling at top speeds of more than 150 mph  but there have been many snafus  in 2010  transportation secretary roy lahood redirected  810 million from wisconsin and  400 million from ohio after those states  governors cited opposition to the projects  the tussle over budget cuts further hampered funding in 2011  that same year  florida gov rick scott rejected a plan to run highspeed rail between tampa and orlando lrb and eventually spread to miami and jacksonville rrb  florida subsequently lost  24 billion in federal funding  and 24 states submitted requests for portions of florida s allotted money  in california  billions of federal dollars were pledged for highspeed rail  and voters ok d  9 billion in bonds for a bullet train between san diego and san francisco  but the project has been set back by myriad issues  are there safeguards in place in the us that would help prevent a disaster like the one in spain  yes  in fact  those safety regulations may be at the core of why it s difficult for highspeed rail to proliferate in the united states  according to a june report from the competitive enterprise institute  a libertarian think tank  the federal railroad administration  has strict crash safety regulation for passenger railcars which trains in europe  where passenger rail is well established and remarkably safe  do not have to meet   while the us requires the undercarriage of a train to withstand 800000 pounds of force without  permanent deformation   europe designs  trains to gracefully deform in a controlled manner  so that crumple zones absorb the energy of the crash  an approach known as crashenergy management  the  buffstrength  for european trains is 337200 pounds of force  according to the think tank  the fra has other requirements not present in european safety regulations  including requiring that the end of the train have the resistive strength of a halfinch plate of steel and an  anticlimbing mechanism  that prevents train cars from telescoping and mounting each other   the requirements force amtrak and transit authorities across the country to purchase custommade trains that are unnecessarily expensive  underperform and do not meet the best safety practices of the rest of the world   the cei report said ',\n",

up positions around benghazi saturday or sunday and assist people fleeing from the city  the younger gadhafi said there will be no largescale assault  instead police and antiterrorism units will be

will be critical to the response to gadhafi  and that he will travel to the region  to advance our common efforts in this critical hour   british foreign secretary william hague said the un vote shows the need for libyan citizens  to have a more representative government   earlier thursday  libyan state tv said benghazi would soon come under attack  gadhafi said that his forces would enter the city to rid it of those  traitors  and that his forces will search everyone for weapons  he added that his forces gave amnesty to those who gave up their weapons in the city of ajdabiya   we will not allow further bloodshed among libyans   gadhafi said   search for the traitors  for the fanatics  show them no mercy  we will look for them behind every wall   gadhafi said   this farce can not go on

the opposition says it has a handful of jets that are no match with gadhafi s superior air power and a pair of russianmade  hind  attack helicopters  ajdabiya is the last major point between progovernment forces and benghazi  if it is retaken by progadhafi forces  it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition s base  in remarks to the us senate foreign relations

advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military firepower   burns said  he expressed fear that gadhafi  now isolated by the world community  could turn to terrorism again   i think there is also a very real danger that if gadhafi is successful on the ground  that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well  the danger of him returning to terrorism and violent extremism himself  the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region   burns told the committee  cnn s arwa damon  nic robertson  tommy evans  elise

              " 'lrb cnn rrb  may we spend a few minutes discussing a major part of american life where there has been a shocking lack of diversity  this has to do with presidential elections  and it s not what you think  throughout us history  ivy league colleges have had an outsized proportion of alumni who became president  harvard alone has eight  if  as is widely expected  it s barack obama versus mitt romney in november  the ivy league is the guaranteed winner again  because it will be harvard against harvard  lrb harvard s romney has even  in speeches  criticized harvard s obama for spending too much time  at the faculty lounge at harvard   rrb in fact  it has been 28 years since a nonharvardoryale graduate has been elected president  george hw bush  bill clinton  george w bush and obama all went to one lrb or both rrb of those universities  in four of those elections  the winning ivy leaguer ran against another ivy leaguer lrb michael dukakis  incumbent president george hw bush  al gore  john kerry rrb  but that s not the oddity we re discussing today  we all know  and have known for a long time  that in presidential elections  as in much of american life  the ivy league has a leg up  and many of our presidents  to their credit  have come from small  nonglitzy colleges  lyndon johnson hailed from southwest texas state teachers college  richard nixon went to whittier college  ronald reagan went to eureka college  nine presidents either never went to college at all  or never received a degree  they were no slouches  they include abraham lincoln and harry truman  here  though  is the strange  almost inexplicable  thing  and it stands out for those of us who attended  and really liked  big ten schools  no graduate of a big ten university has ever been elected president  is nt that something  heart of the country  large student populations  fine faculties  national renown  yet in the history of the united states  the voters have not even once seen fit to send a big ten graduate to the white house  it s not that talent  leadership and creativity are lacking in big ten students  every member of the big ten lrb there are 12 schools in the conference now  since the addition of penn state and nebraska rrb has had numerous graduates  undergraduate and advanceddegree  who have done remarkable things  neil armstrong  of purdue  was the first human to set foot on the moon  jack welch  of the university of illinois  led general electric during glorious years  george gallup  of the university of iowa  founded the legendary public opinion poll  cynthia ozick  of ohio state  is a widely acclaimed author  barbara franklin  of penn state  went on to become a us secretary of commerce  james earl jones  of the university of michigan  became an esteemed actor  arthur goldberg  of northwestern  was a justice of the us supreme court  mildred jeffrey  of the university of minnesota  was a women s movement  labor and civil rights leader who was awarded the presidential medal of freedom  william s harley  of the university of wisconsin  was the cofounder of harleydavidson  alfred d hershey  of michigan state  was a nobel laureate for physiologymedicine  ernie pyle  of indiana university  left for a reporting job just before graduating  and went on to become perhaps the most admired newspaperman who ever lived  the university brought him back to present him with an honorary degree  and johnny carson  of the university of nebraska  well  he was johnny carson  which just may have been better than being president  the list of big ten achievers goes on and on  yet voters have sent no one from a big ten school to the white house  lrb if you re thinking  what about gerald ford  the president from the university of michigan  yes  he became president  but the voters never elected him on a presidential ticket  a fact that bothered him for the rest of his life  when he did run on his own  he was defeated by jimmy carter  of georgia southwestern college  georgia tech and the us naval academy rrb  you would think that being from the big ten would provide a campaign plus  heartland  breadbasket  center of the nation  the warm symbolism of all that  ivy league graduates may take pride in their education  but they tend not to stress their ivy leagueness to voters in a presidential campaign  like being rich  being from the ivy league is something that may be privately savored  but that  in national elections  is best not flaunted in front of those without the same advantages  being from the big ten  on the other hand  would seem to be a ticket to 1600 pennsylvania avenue  but it has nt  julian e zelizer  professor of history and public affairs at princeton university lrb alma mater of presidents james madison and woodrow wilson rrb  said that he  too  is puzzled by this  one reason for it  he said  may be that at universities that have a tradition of educating future presidents   students often become part of networks of classmates who go on to do big things in washington  these networks are essential when potential candidates are identified to run for president   still  said zelizer  whose work regularly appears in the cnn opinion section   it is unclear why someone from the big ten would not be president  given the great quality of these institutions and impressive record  including in politics  of many of these graduates   so what could it be  is it simply a jinx  you might be tempted to say that the big ten is the chicago cubs of presidential politics  except  even though it has been more than a century  the cubs did win a world series  you might be tempted to say that the big ten is the susan lucci of presidential politics  except that the soap opera actress  after years of being passed over  finally was awarded an emmy  the big ten has a council of presidents and chancellors  i asked some of its members what they make of this  not surprisingly  speaking from the middle of the country  they were optimistic and proud  france a cordova  president of purdue university  said   if you knew our current students and could witness their abilities as young leaders  you would be as confident as i am that we will see a boilermaker become the potus   ohio state president gordon gee expressed great contentment about his part of the nation   as to no president coming from the big ten  i would say that many have come from big ten country  we just have sent them off elsewhere  that is ending  by the way    we did offer  twice   said university of minnesota president eric kaler  pointing out that minnesota graduates hubert humphrey and walter mondale were democratic nominees for president  they were defeated by nixon and reagan   you never say never   kaler said   of course it could happen   and sally mason  president of the university of iowa  summed it all up with a surehanded sense of sunny big ten perseverance   in the words of randy travis and bb king  perhaps  it s just a matter of time    the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of bob greene ',\n",

 a retired 20year army veteran  said with amusementtinged pride  but it s not just the cars  including the original s series sedans and coupes  that turn people into  saturnistas   it s also the pleasant buying experience and overthetop customer service   it s a family  it s the saturn family  and you become part of that family   pearson said  all three sky owners from hixson had stories to

treatment of customers beats them all   the best experience i ve ever had was with saturn  bar none   she said  koonce  of dayton  ohio  used to feel that way  too  but koonce now says gm might as well kill off the brand  because that would be preferable to the slow death she sees as inevitable  saturn sold slightly more than 8000 cars in november and has delivered about 175000 this year  that s a far cry from the half a million gm had hoped to sell each year when it introduced saturn  koonce said she fell in love with saturn before she was old enough to drive  she became such a familiar figure at her local saturn dealer and so knowledgeable about its lineup that she was hired as a sales consultant  she and her husband  nick  met at a saturn owners  event  their wedding was a saturn owners  event  and they have owned six saturns between them  they have brought numerous relatives and friends  into the saturn cult   said nick  whose dream is to own a saturn dealership  saturn was

abandoned what made saturn different  the cars are now made of metal  and the models all have twins in other gm divisions  even the original spring hill factory has been converted to build chevrolets instead of saturns  the saturn vue is built in mexico  so disillusioned was koonce that she quit her job at the saturn dealership and went back to college   it was a success that became a failure   she said  walter s mcmanus  the head of the automotive analysis division of the university of michigan transportation research institute  says he could see it coming   brand loyalty is overrated   mcmanus stated flatly   it is costly to do all the fuzzies  and saturn s example is clear that it does nt pay off for what is essentially an economycar company  women especially appreciated the saturn

              " 'lrb cnn rrb  phillip garrido was registered as a sex offender  regularly visited by parole officers and fitted with an ankle bracelet to track his movements  but nothing prevented him from being around children  according to a victims  advocacy group  phillip garrido  a registered sex offender  was arraigned in california on friday  garrido is charged with kidnapping jaycee lee dugard in 1991  when she was 11  and raping her over the course of years  police say dugard lived in a huddle of tents and outbuildings hidden behind garrido s home  and gave birth to two daughters  now 11 and 15  fathered by garrido  garrido and his wife nancy were arrested last week  both have pleaded not guilty   here we have a guy who is essentially under every kind of supervision we allow  law enforcement had every tool available to them  and lsb the tools rsb failed   said robert coombs  spokesman for the california coalition against sexual assault  gordon hinkle  spokesman for the state department of corrections and rehabilitation  said a parole officer visited garrido at his home  sometimes unannounced  twice a month  garrido was also required to go to the agent s office once or twice a month  hinkle said  garrido wore a gps anklet  and his movements were tracked passively  hinkle said  meaning parole officers checked his location after the fact  as opposed to active monitoring  which involves watching parolees  comings and goings in real time  despite the tight supervision  garrido  was technically allowed to be around minors   coombs said  because his parole stemmed from the november 1976 rape of katie callaway hall  who was 25 at the time of the assault  he was sentenced in 1977 to 50 years at the federal penitentiary in leavenworth  kansas  for kidnapping  because he abducted hall in california and transported her across the state line to reno  nevada  where he raped her in a warehouse  according to court documents  a nevada court separately sentenced him to five years to life for the rape conviction  the reno gazettejournal reported  while in prison in 1978  garrido sent a handwritten letter to judge bruce r thompson  saying he was recovering from seven years of lsd use and progressing well   i am so ashamed of my past  but my future is now in controle lsb sic rsb   he wrote  court documents show garrido requested that his 50year sentence be reduced to 25  making him eligible for parole in eight years   where he could be released to the state of nevada as an educated person and being a rehabilitated person   according to a 1978 court transcript  attorney willard van hazel jr told a judge   without the influence of any of this drug involvement  i think mr garrido would pause before carrying out sexual fantasies   after more than a decade at leavenworth  garrido received a federal parole but was sent to carson city  nevada  in january 1988 to serve his rape sentence  however  according to the reno gazettejournal  he was automatically eligible for state parole because of the time served in federal prison  the nevada offender tracking information system indicates he appeared four times before the parole board  which granted his request in august 1988  about 11 years after he was incarcerated  he moved to antioch  california  three years later  11yearold dugard was abducted from her home in south lake tahoe  california  about 100 miles northeast   he served about 20 percent of his sentence  and it does nt take a mathematician to figure out if he served only onethird of his sentence  jaycee dugard does nt end up in the predicament that she s in   said andy kahan  a crime victims  advocate in houston  texas  citing revised federal sentencing guidelines  kahan and illinois defense attorney stephen komie concur that this is not something that could happen today   if he got 50 years  say  he would have 600 months  he would only get 50 months off  he would do 550 months   komie said   so this would not be repeated in the federal system again   added kahan   you re going to have to do at least a minimum of half of your term without any good time credits before you can even see the light of day or say hello to a parole board member   in 1993  five years after his release from a nevada prison  garrido was jailed on a parole violation  but it s unclear what that offense was  tom hutchinson  spokesman for the us parole commission  said documents have been requested and should be available later this week  garrido was released later that year  california took over his parole supervision in 1999  hinkle said  but regular visits did nothing to unearth dugard s abduction or garrido s backyard secrets  another visit by law enforcement was the direct result of a 2006 call a neighbor made to 911  reporting that women and children were living in tents behind garrido s house  contra costa county sheriff warren e rupf said he did nt think the deputy who responded knew at the time that garrido was a sex offender and the deputy spoke to garrido in the home s front yard   we should have been more inquisitive  more curious and turned over a rock or two   the sheriff said   we missed an opportunity to bring earlier closure to this situation   hinkle acknowledged that neighbors called police again with a similar complaint in 2008  to his knowledge  hinkle said  the deputy did nt contact garrido s parole officer in either instance  even if the deputy had made contact  there is no guarantee the parole officer would have found the compound  it was that wellhidden  hinkle said   if you were to walk in the backyard  you would see a fence that ran from one end to the other   hinkle said  describing how the fence created the illusion of a  false backyard    it would not be immediately apparent that lsb the tents and outbuildings were rsb back there   he said  kahan partially blames the economics of the criminal justice system  not just in california  but nationwide  and said garrido likely became less of a priority as the time since his crimes passed  despite the heinous nature of garrido s 1976 crime  it paled in comparison to allegedly holding a young girl hostage and raping her for 18 years  coombs said   nothing in this guy s case history indicated he was capable of such evil  if you will   he said   it was so far out of the picture  they did nt even look for it   rather than there not being enough money to fund the proper supervision of parolees  it s more a matter of priorities  coombs said  citing the gps device garrido wore on his ankle  although calcasa has no official tally  it estimates california has spent roughly  500 million on gps devices for 6600 of the state s sex offenders  garrido was fitted with a device after 2006 when voters ok d a law requiring felony sex offenders to wear tracking devices for life   we know where this guy is  so we think we re safe   he said   but the place where we knew he was was the place where he was offending  gps just tells you where they are  it does nt tell you what they re doing   each dollar spent on gps equipment  is one dollar you re not spending on real  traditional parole techniques  like talking to collateral contacts and neighbors   he said  coombs also criticized the lack of communication across jurisdictions  had garrido s parole officer received a call from police and spoken to the neighbor who made the 911 call in 2006  authorities might have found dugard three years earlier  coombs said  hinkle said the officer who flushed out garrido s alleged crimes had only been supervising him since december  when the officer learned from campus police that garrido had 11  and 15yearold girls in tow while proselytizing at the university of californiaberkeley  he called garrido in for a meeting  garrido arrived with his wife  dugard and the two girls  hinkle would not provide details of the conversation  it could affect the investigation and prosecution  he said  but he did say garrido and his wife were not forthcoming about dugard s and the girls  identities  it was the parole officer s diligence that ultimately yielded the garridos  arrest and dugard and her daughters  freedom  said hinkle   they were coming in being elusive and deceptive about their identities  and the agent would not let go   cnn s mallory simon  irving last and kiran chetry

mysteries and has debuted a new series  the prolific writer seemingly wrapped up his beloved series  which spawned the 1995 film  devil in a blue dress  starring denzel washington  in 2007 with the 10th easy rawlins mystery   blonde faith   the ending saddened diehard fans who had faithfully followed the adventures of the los angeles  californiabased everymanturnedprivate investigator whose stories played out in an era from the jim crow 1940s to the politically charged 1960s  now mosley  who has found success writing everything from erotica to science fiction  has launched a new mystery series with the release of his book  the long fall  lrb riverhead rrb  the book features an exboxer named leonid trotter mcgill  the latest colorfully named mosley character  three of his previous books involved exconvict socrates fortlow  and another trio concerned bookseller paris minton  but the new novel takes mosley to a different place and time  instead of mid20th century los angeles   the long fall  is set in modernday new york  where mcgill is finding it hard to leave his lessthanstellar past behind  that past includes a childhood as a reddiaper baby abandoned by his union organizer father and left to fend for himself at an early age  a loveless marriage to an unfaithful woman named katrina and a son who s a burgeoning criminal mastermind  moreover  he s at work on a case where you just know people are going to die  such page turners are nothing new for mosley  who is known for his strong  black male characters and his passionate musings on race  politics and the writing life  mcgill s creator recently spoke with cnn about the new mystery novel  why he does nt miss easy  and how the changes in the united states are mirrored in his writing  the following is an edited version of the interview  cnn  why leave los angeles for a setting in modernday new york  walter mosley  i have been a resident of both cities  the new series being contemporary and about a character who in some murky ways reflects where america is right now  new york seemed the right place for that  cnn  how so  where do you think america is right now  mosley  i think that america has made a decision  after about 20 years of going in one direction  to go in another direction  to leave rampant and amoral kind of deregulation and also rampant and immoral wars and say   maybe we should be doing the right thing instead of the wrong thing   or redefining what the right thing is  at any rate  those kinds of decisions  there are only two places lsb the setting rsb can be  and that s either in washington  dc  which i feel is very limiting because it s a onebusiness town  or new york  where everything from economics to government is centered  so i decided on new york  cnn  mcgill is trying to leave behind his shady past  do you feel like america is trying to do the same  mosley  yes  i think that s exactly what s happening  i think america is trying to seek redemption after having done many things wrong in the eyes of the world in general  leonid mcgill is trying to seek redemption after a long criminal history  his history is somewhat forgivable  but still it s criminal  cnn  did you approach this book differently than you did when you were writing the easy rawlins mysteries  mosley  yes and no  all books are different  so each of the easy rawlins books i wrote i approached differently  lsb leonid rsb is a new character and he has a unique life that i had to begin to learn  i knew easy very well  but leonid i had to learn who he was  cnn  in your new book  i love that mcgill s wife s name is  katrina  and she leaves lots of destruction in her wake  mosley  lsb chuckling rsb it s true  but the first story i wrote about leonid lsb a story called  karma  published in the anthology  dangerous women  rsb was before the hurricane and that was a long time ago  it s funny that it worked out like that  cnn  what do you like about mcgill  mosley  this is the first time in my experiments in crime fiction that i ve written a hardboiled detective character  this is going all the way back to the beginning of the genre in the 30s  where you have a guy who gets thumped upside the head a lot and he s just as bad as the people he s after  in the old style  you never knew what was going on inside the hardboiled character s head  but in these stories i am actually discovering the underlying character of the hardboiled detective  and for me that s been a great deal of fun  cnn  you ve written so many various genres  what is it about the genre of crime fiction that appeals to you  mosley  originally i got into it because you can talk about worlds that people would nt read about ordinarily unless they had a particular interest in it  everybody reads crime fiction and they read it to find out about different worlds  i like writing in different genres  there s all this stuff that i really enjoy doing because i think they all serve different purposes  and listen  i m known as a crime writer  people like it and i enjoy it  cnn  for your fans  a lot of them miss easy rawlins  do you miss him at all  mosley  no  he s right there on the shelf  all i have to do is reach up and pull him down  i m finished with that  i m moving on ',\n",

        "new_article = \"\"\" It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\" It's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react? In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. \"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\" Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said. Transcript: Read Obama's full remarks . Syrian crisis: Latest developments . U.N. inspectors leave Syria . Obama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb. \"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday. But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis. Top U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. \"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said. He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\" Bergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama: 'This menace must be confronted' Obama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies. On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said. Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month \"is an assault on human dignity,\" the president said. A failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  \"could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.\" Syria missile strike: What would happen next? Map: U.S. and allied assets around Syria . Obama decision came Friday night . On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers. What will happen if they vote no? It's unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government. He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech. \"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,\" the White House said. Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions: U.S. intelligence report on Syria . Syria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . Reactions mixed to Obama's speech . A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama's announcement. \"Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,\" said spokesman Louay Safi. \"So we are quite concerned.\" Some members of Congress applauded Obama's decision. House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president. \"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\" the Republican lawmakers said. \"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.\" More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama's fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a \"full debate\" before any U.S. action. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama's speech in a Twitter post Saturday. \"I understand and support Barack Obama's position on Syria,\" Cameron said. An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory. \"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,\" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post. In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday. \"Like many other Americans...we're just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,\" said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration. What do Syria's neighbors think? Why Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad . Syria's government unfazed . After Obama's speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is \"embarrassed\" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is \"crying for help\" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels. Syria's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling. \"The Syrian Army's status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,\" Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama's address. An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama \"appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.\" A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States. \"I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,\" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations. Both Obama and Cameron, he said, \"climbed to the top of the tree and don't know how to get down.\" The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. On Saturday, Obama said \"all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy. Iran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark 'disaster' Opinion: Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea . \"\"\"\n",
